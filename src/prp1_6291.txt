LIMITATIONS:
Limited compression with already compressed pdfs
http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/ was used to uncompress - compressed pdfs for testing

USAGE:
Encode : Henc_6291 encodes filename into filename.huf and filename gets erased
thus x.pdf generates x.pdf.huf and then x.pdf gets erased

Decode : Hdec_6291 decodes filename.huf into filename and filename.huf gets erased
if filename already exists, it gets overwritten
thus x.pdf.huf generates x.pdf and then x.pdf.huf gets erased
